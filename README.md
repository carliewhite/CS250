SNHU Software Development Lifecycle

When developing software, its important to collect the customer and client requirements in a way that can be interpreted by you team, and this is done by creating user stories. Creating user stories in a specific format gives the team an understanding of what the requirement is and what is it for.

Developing porgrams is similar to wriitng a story, they can always be improved and are ever-evolving. We call it a software development cycle because it is a cycle, after the release you are not done, yet you are working on the new update to fix and bugs or features that were in the previous release. As I venture into software development, I believe that it is very important to incorporate agile principles into my work, including iterative development and open communication amongst everyone involved in the process. 

To be a good team member on a software development team is to listen to others on your team and be open to reccomendations and others ideas while also staying true to your own ideas and communicating them to your team and asking for help when you need it. It's never good to spend a lot of time on something that is frustrating you or that your stuck on and it's better to get a second or third set of eyes on the issue as soon as you can.
